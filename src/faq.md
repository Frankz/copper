Thanks for your interest! This book is currently outdated so I'm taking it down
until I get time to update it; that way it won't cause more confusion. In the
meantime, you can read [this blog post] that covers the *easy*, high level way
of writing Rust applications for any ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.

<!-- # FAQ -->

<!-- ## Can I use my Arduino to follow this material? -->

<!-- If you have an Arduino Due then the answer is yes. -->

<!-- The other Arduinos have AVR processors and `rustc` can't compile programs for that architecture yet. -->
<!-- See [Why ARM Cortex-M micros?] for more details. -->
