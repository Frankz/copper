Thanks for your interest! This book is currently outdated so I'm taking it down
until I get time to update it; that way it won't cause more confusion. In the
meantime, you can read [this blog post] that covers the *easy*, high level way
of writing Rust applications for any ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.

<!-- # Audience -->

<!-- > Who is this documentation aimed towards? -->

<!-- This site is aimed at people that: -->

<!-- - Have a basic knowledge of Rust. If you haven't been introduced to Rust yet, you should check out -->
<!--   the (Rust) ["book"] and [these other great learning resources][0]. -->

<!-- ["book"]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ -->
<!-- [0]: https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning -->

<!-- - Have access, own, or are willing to buy an ARM Cortex-M development board. -->

<!-- > **NOTE** You *can* follow this material *without* a dev board by using an emulator. But your -->
<!-- > learning experience (and enjoyment!) will likely suffer as you will only be able to execute a few -->
<!-- > of the programs that we'll develop here due to limitations in emulators (not all the -->
<!-- > microcontroller functionality is implemented). -->

<!-- On the other hand, you **don't** need to know about any of these topics to follow this material:  -->

<!-- - Assembly. -->
<!-- - Electronics. -->
<!-- - Microcontrollers. -->
<!-- - The ARM (Cortex-M) architecture. -->
<!-- - The C programming language. -->

<!-- If you are already familiar with embedded development using C/C++, please tag along! I'm sure you'll -->
<!-- find the information about tooling (Cargo instead of Make) and Rust abstractions (traits as -->
<!-- interfaces) interesting. Plus, I'd love to hear your opinion about how non-Rust concepts (like the -->
<!-- ARM boot process, linker scripts, etc) are explained. -->
