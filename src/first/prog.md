Thanks for your interest! This book is currently outdated so I'm taking it down
until I get time to update it; that way it won't cause more confusion. In the
meantime, you can read [this blog post] that covers the *easy*, high level way
of writing Rust applications for any ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.

<!-- # First program -->

<!-- In this chapter we'll write our first program! Although the program is going to be relatively -->
<!-- uninteresting -- it just allocates some variables on the stack. It will help us: -->

<!-- - Verify that the development environment is correctly set up. -->
<!-- - Get familiar with the several tools that make up the development environment. -->
<!-- - Learn about the device-specific pieces required for cross compilation. -->

<!-- We'll first cross compile this program for the [LM3S6965][0] microcontroller and then run it under -->
<!-- QEMU. After we verify that it works correctly, we'll run the program on real hardware. -->
