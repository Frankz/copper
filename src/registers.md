Thanks for your interest! This book is currently outdated so I'm taking it down
until I get time to update it; that way it won't cause more confusion. In the
meantime, you can read [this blog post] that covers the *easy*, high level way
of writing Rust applications for any ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.

<!-- # Zero-cost type-safe register manipulation -->

<!-- Goals: -->

<!-- - Go from hexadecimal gibberish to structs. -->
<!-- - Prevent writing to read-only registers and viceversa. -->
<!-- - Prevent reading to,writing to or modifying reserved bits. -->
<!-- - Nicer debugging experience: `print GPIOA` -> you get all the registers in that register block and -->
<!--   their values. -->
